# My-Calculator-App
A simple calculator app built with Python.
# Simple Full-Stack Calculator

This project is a simple calculator built to practice core programming concepts. It includes a backend logic module and two different frontends: a desktop GUI and a web interface.

This was built as part of a guided learning session.

## Features

* Performs basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* Separates core logic from the user interface.
* Includes two user interfaces:
    1.  A desktop GUI built with **CustomTkinter**.
    2.  A web-based UI built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
* The web app features a **Flask** backend to serve the calculation logic via an API.

## Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Python, Flask
* **Desktop GUI:** CustomTkinter
* **Web Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Version Control:** Git / GitHub

## How to Run

### Web Application

1.  Ensure you have the required libraries installed: `pip install Flask Flask-CORS`
2.  In your terminal, start the backend server: `python server.py`
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Desktop Application

1.  Ensure you have CustomTkinter installed: `pip install customtkinter`
2.  In your terminal, run the GUI application: `python main_app.py`
